[//]: # (Lu Chen, Associate Researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University &#40;SJTU&#41;. His main research interests include dialogue-based large language models like ChatGPT, natural language processing, and AI for Science. He has published over 40 papers in major international conferences and journals such as TPAMI, NeurIPS, and ACL. His research has been recognized with several awards, including the Area Chair Recommendation Award at the prestigious international conference COLING2018 on natural language processing, the Best Paper Award at the 17th National Conference on Man-Machine Speech Communication &#40;NCMMSC2022&#41;, the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020, the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Nomination Award of the China Computer Federation &#40;CCF&#41; in 2021, and the ACM China &#40;Shanghai Chapter&#41; Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2021. He has led teams to participate in and win championships or first prizes in several authoritative challenges and technical evaluations in the fields of intelligent human-computer dialogue and intelligent question answering &#40;including DSTC, Spider, CSpider, CBLUE2.0, etc.&#41;. Some of his research achievements have been widely applied through industry-university-research collaborations, and his patents have won the Excellence Award at the 23rd China Patent Awards. He also serves as an Area Chair for the Association for Computational Linguistics Rolling Review &#40;ACL ARR&#41;, a Standing Reviewer for the top-tier journal Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics &#40;TACL&#41;, and has been a Program Committee member for major international academic conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, ACL, and EMNLP.)

Lu Chen, Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and full-time mentor at Shanghai Innovation Institute. His research focuses on foundational technologies for LLMs, agents, and their cross-disciplinary applications in science. He has authored or co-authored over 60 papers as first or corresponding author in Cell Press journals, TPAMI, and TACL, as well as at major AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL. He holds more than 30 granted patents, 10 of which have been successfully transferred; one transferred patent received the Excellence Award at the 23rd China Patent Awards (23rd edition). He led the development of the DFM series of conversational LLMs (including ChemDFM for chemistry and materials), whose underlying technologies have been widely deployed in intelligent vehicle cockpits, smart homes, and scientific research. He has long served as an Area Chair for the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) and as a reviewer for Nature and its family journals.
