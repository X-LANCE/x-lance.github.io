Welcome to SJTU X-LANCE Lab!

The SJTU Cross Media Language Intelligence Lab (X-LANCE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was established in 2012. Originally known as the "SpeechLab," it has evolved over the years to become the "Cross-Modal Language Intelligence Lab," encompassing core research areas in audiovisual and language information processing. Currently, the lab's faculty includes one professor, four associate professors, and one research assistant, along with over twenty doctoral students and near forty master's students. It also includes over thirty undergraduate students from programs such as ACM class, AI class, IEEE class, the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, SJTU Paris Elite Institute of Technology (SPEIT), and the UM-SJTU Joint Institute.

The lab has received numerous national and corporate project supports, including the National Key R&D Program and the Excellent Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. It has a deep collaboration with AISpeech Co., Ltd., establishing the "SJTU-AISpeech Joint Lab for Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction." The lab has access to rich data resources and extensive computing resources, including hundreds of GPU cards like H800, A800, and A10, making it one of the few AI labs in the world capable of conducting industrial-scale data analysis and research.

X-LANCE Lab is dedicated to conducting world-class technical research that can change the world. The lab's academic credo is: *To change the world, you must be an engineer! An outstanding engineer must be an excellent scientist who deeply understands the world!*
